Convert the Eltako Series 62-IP data to MQTT messages

This application will post two MQTT messages for each connected device: one short message and a full message.

# Releases

Currently, no releases are available.
The implementation is still in development and supports only the `ESB62NP-IP/110-240V` motion blind actor.
